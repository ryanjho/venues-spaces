Heroku Link: https://venuespaces.herokuapp.com/ 


## Application Description

Venue owners will be able to keep track of their enquiries received from consumers, while consumers are able to keep track of their enquiries submitted to venue owners.


## Database / Storage

* Express.js
* EJS View Engine
* Method-override
* Bcrypt
* Heroku (For application deployment)


## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a CRUD application (Create, Read, Update and Delete) with the MVC framework (Model, View, Controller) using Node.js, MongoDB, Express and EJS.

## Approach Taken
* Set up MVC structure with basic CRUD routes for venue owners first, and then users next
* Set up database with relevant collections and schema validation in MongoDB 
* Implement unit testing 
* Build authentication flow for both venue owners and users
* Update UX layer with HTML, CSS enhancements
* Deploy application on Heroku

## Accomplishments
* Venue Spaces application is able to meet MVP requirements with CRUD functions for both venue owners and users
* Venue owner is able to sign up for an account, login and add new venue listing, edit existing venue listing and delete existing venue listing
* User is able to sign up for an account, login and submit new enquiry to a venue listing. User is also able to view all submited enquiries
* Authentication layer

## Difficulties Faced
* Managing the growing number of routes as more features are added to the application
* Implementing more extensive unit testing to ensure robustness of application
* Time management with heavy work schedule

## Additional Features
* Social Login Authentication (e.g. Google OAuth, Facebook OAuth, etc)
* Google Maps embedding for Venue Listing Address
* In-built chat application
* Image album upload
